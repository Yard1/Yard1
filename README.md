# Hi there, I'm Antoni ðŸ‘‹

I'm passionate about distributed computing, LLM/Gen AI systems and open source. I built multiple 0 to 1 systems and products working with diverse teams, tools and constraints. Alawys optimizing for execution, performance and comprehensive solutions to challenging problems.

Currently, I am a Member of Technical Staff @ OpenAI.

Aside from my own projects, I have contributed to or took a leading role in several open source projects. The most notable include:
